Welcome to my app.  If you're here, you're probably either wondering where all the great spots are in East Boston or you want to share your knowledge about them with others.  Explore Eastie is a place to share and find hidden gems in the neighborhood.  It's perfect for locals and travelers alike.

### Strategy and Planning: ###
I started this project with the goal to complete CRUDing the places resource. Once I had that completed, I did the same for the addresses resource. I knew if I could get both then completed, I'd be able to get started using the Google Maps Api.  It was definitely challenging to learn how the Google Map and the Geocoder API work, but it was so worth the effort because I think the map really makes this app more interesting and useful.  When I encountered problems, I did some research and combed through my code, but I've learned to be quick to ask for help and then continue working.  That way, I'm not starting to ask for help when I'm completely out of energy.
